# pianobar-scripts #

PromyLOPh/pianobar allows you to use a FIFO to control it. I wrote these
scripts that send simple commands to pianobar via that FIFO, but are discretely
named so that I can just map different key presses to a particular script.

`pianobar-stop` uses the changes introduced in
https://github.com/axelson/pianobar/commits/scripting-support
